hi everybody,

this code contain configuration of  database(school_db) and tables(teacher_table,class_table,student_table,login_table)

use these commands in your terminal to configure the code correctly:

mysql -u root -p ---> you will open mysql server on your local host as root
mysql>create database school_db; --->the database that we use
mysql>GRANT  GRANT ALL ON school_db.* TO user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';--> (make an account with 'user' user name 'password' password
										     on your local host)

ATTENTION:
dont change the user and password please,

KOOSHA ;)
